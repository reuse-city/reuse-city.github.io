# reuse.city website

This website was created with Hugo. At first I had added the whole hugo folder as a subdirectory under the root folder. After giving up trying to understanding integrated build, I decided to refactor, move hugo outside of the git repo, and start over. Now only the built folder (/public) is included in the repo. I need to build the website locally, but I don't intend to be changing this website that much.
